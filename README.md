## Installation

You can install the package via composer then run the installation command:

```bash
composer require awcodes/filament-curator
php artisan curator:install
```

## Upgrading

If you are upgrading from 1.x to 2.x you will also need to run:

```bash
php artisan curator:upgrade
```

This will update Curator's database schema and create a backup of your media table that can be deleted after upgrade should you choose to do so.

### Additional Steps
1. Change any references in your codebase from `$media->filename` to `$media->path`.
2. Change any use statements from `FilamentCurator` to `Awcodes\Curator`.
3. Change `FilamentCurator\Forms\Components\MediaPicker` fields to
   `Awcodes\Curator\Components\Forms\CuratorPicker`.

## Usage

### Global Settings

Global settings for Curator are handled through the `Curator` facade.
Inside the `register()` method of a service provider you can customize the
behaviour of Curator's resources. All methods are optional.

```php
use Awcodes\Curator\Facades\Curator;

public function register()
{
    Curator::resourceLabel(string|Closure)
        ->pluralResourceLabel(string|Closure)
        ->navigationIcon(string)
        ->navigationSort(int)
        ->navigationGroup(string)
        ->registerNavigation(bool|Closure|null)
        ->tableHasIconActions(bool|Closure|null)
        ->tableHasGridLayout(bool|Closure|null)
        ->curationPresets(array|null)
        ->preserveFilenames(bool|Closure)
        ->acceptedFileTypes(array|Closure)
        ->maxWidth(int|Closure)
        ->minSize(int|Closure)
        ->maxSize(int|Closure)
        ->disk(string|Closure)
        ->directory(string|Closure)
        ->pathGenerator(string|null)
        ->visibility(string|Closure)
        ->cloudDisks(array)
        ->imageCropAspectRatio(string|Closure|null)
        ->imageResizeTargetHeight(string|Closure|null)
        ->imageResizeTargetWidth(string|Closure|null)
        ->glideSourcePathPrefix(string)
        ->glideCachePathPrefix(string)
        ->glideServer(Server|ServerFactory)
        ->glideMaxImageSize(int)
        ->glideDriver(string)
        ->mediaModel(string);
}
```

### Curator Picker Field

Include the CuratorPicker field in your forms to trigger the modal and either
select an existing image or upload a new one. Some common methods
from Filament's `FileUpload` component can be used to help with sizing,
validation, etc. for specific instances of each CuratorPicker.

```php
use Awcodes\Curator\Components\Forms\CuratorPicker;

CuratorPicker::make(string $fieldName)
    ->label(string $customLabel)
    ->buttonLabel(string | Htmlable | Closure $buttonLabel)
    ->color('primary|secondary|success|danger') // defaults to primary
    ->outlined(true|false) // defaults to true
    ->size('sm|md|lg') // defaults to md
    ->constrained(true|false) // defaults to false (forces image to fit inside 
    the preview area)
    ->contained(true|false) // defaults to false (forces image to stay contained within the preview area)
    ->pathGenerator(DatePathGenerator::class|UserPathGenerator::class) // see path generators below
    // see https://filamentphp.com/docs/2.x/forms/fields#file-upload for more information about the following methods
    ->preserveFilenames()
    ->maxWidth()
    ->minSize()
    ->maxSize()
    ->rules()
    ->acceptedFileTypes()
    ->disk()
    ->visibility()
    ->directory()
    ->imageCropAspectRatio()
    ->imageResizeTargetWidth()
    ->imageResizeTargetHeight()
```

Media can also be related to models by simply adding the relationship to your
model.

```php
use Awcodes\Curator\Models\Media;

public function featuredImage(): HasOne
{
    return $this->hasOne(Media::class, 'id', 'featured_image');
}
```

### Path Generation

By default, Curator will use the directory and disk set in the config to
store your media. If you'd like to store the media in a different way
Curator comes with Path Generators that can be used to modify the behavior.
Just set the one you want to use the `register()` method of a service provider.

```php
public function register()
{
    Curator::pathGenerator(DatePathGenerator::class);
}
```

#### Available Generators

`DefaultPathGenerator` will save files in disk/directory.

`DatePathGenerator` will save files in disk/directory/Y/m/d.

`UserPathGenerator` will save files in disk/directory/user-auth-identifier

You are also free to use your own Path Generators by implementing the
`PathGenerator` interface on your own classes.

```php
use Awcodes\Curator\Generators;

class CustomPathGenerator implements PathGenerator
{
    public function getPath(?string $baseDir = null): string
    {
        return ($baseDir ? $baseDir . '/' : '') . 'my/custom/path';
    }
}
```

Path Generators can also be passed into the `directory()` method on the
`CuratorPicker` field for per instance use.

```php
CuratorPicker::make(string $fieldName)
    ->label(string $customLabel)
    ->pathGenerator(CustomPathGenerator::class),
```

### Curator Column

To render your media in a table Curator comes with an `CuratorColumn` which has the same methods as Filament's ImageColumn.

```php
CuratorColumn::make('featured_image')
    ->size(40)
```

### Curations

Curations are a way to create custom sizes and focal points for your images. After creating curation, they can be referenced by their key to output them in your blade files.

```php
use Awcodes\Curator\CurationPreset;

Curator::curationPresets([
    CurationPreset::make(name: 'thumbnail')->width(200)->height(200)->name('Thumbnail'),
    CurationPreset::make(name: 'avatar')->width(420)->height(420)->name('Avatar'),
    CurationPreset::make(name: 'hero')->width(1024)->height(320)->name('Hero'),
]);
```

### Glider Blade Component

To make it as easy as possible to output your media, Curator comes with an
`<x-curator-glider>` blade component.

See [Glide's quick reference](https://glide.thephpleague.com/2.0/api/quick-reference/) for more information about Glide's options.

**Special attributes**

- media: id (int) or model (Media) instance ***required***
- loading: defaults to 'lazy'
- glide: this can be used to pass in a glide query string if you do not want to use individual attributes
- srcset: this will output the necessary srcset with glide generated urls.
  Must be an array of srcset widths and requires the 'sizes' attribute to
  also be set.

```html
<div class="aspect-video w-64">
    <x-curator-glider
        class="object-cover w-auto"
        :media="1"
        glide=""
        :srcset="['1024w','640w']"
        sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1024px"
        background=""
        blur=""
        border=""
        brightness=""
        contrast=""
        crop=""
        device-pixel-ratio=""
        filter=""
        fit=""
        flip=""
        format=""
        gamma=""
        height=""
        quality=""
        orientation=""
        pixelate=""
        sharpen=""
        width=""
        watermark-path=""
        watermark-width=""
        watermark-height=""
        watermark-x-offset=""
        watermark-y-offset=""
        watermark-padding=""
        watermark-position=""
        watermark-alpha=""
    />
</div>
```

### Curation Blade Component

To make it as easy as possible to output your curations, Curator comes with an
`<x-curator-curation>` blade component.

**Special attributes**

- media: id (int) or model (Media) instance ***required***

```html
<x-curator-curation :media="10" curation="thumbnail" loading="lazy" />
```

### Practical use case

Since curations may or may not exist for each media item it's good to use a fallback to the glider component in your blade file so images always get rendered appropriately. This also keeps you from having to create curations for every media item, only the ones where you're trying to change the focal point, etc.

```html
@if ($media->hasCuration('thumbnail'))
    <x-curator-curation :media="$media" curation="thumbnail" />
@else
    <x-curator-glider
        class="object-cover w-auto"
        :media="$media"
        :width="curator()->preset('thumbnail')['width']"
        :height="curator()->preset('thumbnail')['height']"
    />
@endif
```

### Custom Resource

Should you need to override the default Resource, it is recommended
that you use the service container.

```php
use Awcodes\Curator\Resources\MediaResource;

class YourNotAsCoolMediaResource extends MediaResource
{
    // ... custom methods and properties
}

// and in a service provider
public function register()
{
    $this->app->bind(MediaResource::class, fn() => new YourNotAsCoolMediaResource());
}
```

## Theming

If you are using a custom theme for Filament you will need to add this plugin's
views to your Tailwind CSS config.

```js
content: [
    ...
    "./vendor/awcodes/curator/resources/views/**/*.blade.php",
]
```

## Testing
